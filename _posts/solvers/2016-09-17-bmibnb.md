BMIBNB is an implementation of a standard branch & bound algorithm for nonconvex problems, based on [(most often) linear programming relaxations and convex envelope approximations](/tutorial/envelopesinbmibnb). The [tutorial about global optimization](/tutorial/globaloptimization) focus on applications of the solver.

The solver relies on external linear, quadratic and semidefinite programming solvers for solving the lower bounding relaxation problems, and nonlinear solvers for the upper bound computations.

Most important options (-1 means adaptive choice, 0 is off and 1 on)

			longer be used when the upper bound has been improved <code>numglobal</code> times.
			This option is useful if you believe your local solver quickly gives
			globally optimal solutions. It can also be useful if you have a
			feasible solution and just want to compute a gap. In this case, use
			the <code>usex0</code> option and set <code>numglobal</code> to 0.</td>
